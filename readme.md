# TIN62109 â€“ Computer Programming (3/P)

**Description**

The course is about computer programming, focusing on the introduction to Python. It is a beginning course (not for experienced programmers) in which students can learn and practice coding.  The course includes video content, practice labs, and coding projects.

The course content is presented in three units.

* [Unit 1](https://github.com/Universitas-Andalas/TIN62109-Computer-Programming/blob/main/Unit%201%20Practice%20Files/readme.md) focuses on Python language basics, introducing data types, variables, input, functions, operators, conditional statements, loops, and incrementing. Students will be introduced to the basic structure of the Python 3 language and be ready to take Unit 2 as well as other beginner courses.
* [Unit 2](https://github.com/Universitas-Andalas/TIN62109-Computer-Programming/blob/main/Unit%202%20Practice%20Files/readme.md) focuses on Python data structures such as strings, lists, and range sequences, as well as methods for working with these structures. Students will be introduced to data structures and files in Python 3 and be ready for more advanced Python learning.
* [Unit 3](https://github.com/Universitas-Andalas/TIN62109-Computer-Programming/blob/main/Unit%203%20Practice%20Files/readme.md) focuses on using Python to develop sustainable code. Students will be introduced to data structures and files in Python 3 and be ready for more advanced Python learning.

The course content is inline to Microsoft Certification in the Data Science Certification route.

**Course Timing**

This course will be delivered over approximately 20 weeks, at a rate of one module per week. An average beginner student can complete the course instruction and core lab assignments in 3-4 hours per module. Additional study time can be allocated to exploring suggested resources and experimenting with knowledge gained while completing the practice tasks and labs.

**Grading**

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Module assessments (Quizzes, Mid and Final semester assessments) | 50% |
| Module coding assignments | 20% |
| Final coding assignment (Projects) | 30% |

**Learning Management Systems**

Students must enrol themselves in iLearn ([https://eng.ilearn.unand.ac.id/](https://eng.ilearn.unand.ac.id/)) and course groups in Microsoft Teams ([http://portal.office.com/](http://portal.office.com/)). Microsoft PowerPoint slides and other course-related files will be provided in both systems.

**Tool**

For the use of ease and implementation, this course will focus on using Visual Studio Code ([https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/)) Integrated Development Environment (IDE). Visual Studio Code is a lightweight but powerful source code editor which runs on the desktop and is available for Windows, macOS, Linux, and Chromebook. Course modules with the practices will use the Visual Studio Code.
